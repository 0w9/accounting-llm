# Pacioliabacus LLM v1

This custom and private LLM is designed to be trained on accounting guides and examples. It is the first phase of developing an accounting AI for small businesses. This will make accounting not only cheaper, but mostly an easy and time-saving process in comparison to hiring a fulltime accountant.

Currently this is a hobby project but we are looking to scale in the next few months.
